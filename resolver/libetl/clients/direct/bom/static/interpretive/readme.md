NB:
The server supports the 'newer' command which, when performed, retrieves a
file as per the get command but only if the file has been updated since the last
fetch (by using time stamp comparisons).
For example, the following Unix shell script will fetch the Sydney
Metropolitan forecast (with ID code IDN10064), if a newer version exists:

ftp -n ftp2.bom.gov.au << END
user ftp your_name@your_e-mail_address
cd /anon/gen/fwo
newer IDN10064.txt
quit
END

Your e-mail address is suggested for identification only. We will not send e-mail to you.
